        I am a self-taught software developer speciailising in React and Node.js 
        with two years of coding experience.
        I learned to code using various courses on Udemy and YouTube, and I have built several side
        projects to gain practical experience.
        Last year I built and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) for my company's branch that I have
        used to automate inventory, cusomter and invoicing managerment and deliveries which has saved me 
        more than 20 hours of work a month. It currently has over 90 clients loaded onto the system.
        I have also written a React-Hooks library and published it to NPM.
        </p>

        I have 2 years experience as a Technical Sales and Support Engineer but I am now looking to pivot
        into a full-time software developer role. I thoroughly enjoy building data driven web applications
        and using technology as an enabler to solve problems
        </p>
        <p>
        I value team culture and working with people who will encourage and push me to grow.

        <p>I am currently based in Stellenbosch, South Africa</p>
